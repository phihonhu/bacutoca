# Angular Training

This temporary repository is designed as a place for people to
practice learning Angular development, testing and best practices
providing a place to store and share code.

## Peer review

As well as working through Angular tutorials and exercises it is
highly recommended to "peer review" other code in this repository
to check logic, style, examples and compare with your own development.
